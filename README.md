* **Persistent Storage:** Notes are saved locally in your browser, so they're available even after you close and reopen the page.
* **Color-Coded Notes:** Create notes with different background colors (e.g., using a color picker or predefined options).  *(Optional, implement if you added this feature)*
* **Responsive Design:**  The app adapts to different screen sizes. *(Optional, implement if you added this feature)*
